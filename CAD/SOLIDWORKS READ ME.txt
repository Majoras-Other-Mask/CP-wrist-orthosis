This is the most up to date Solidworks model for the wrist orthosis robot. 
The model was created by Devon Holley and updated by Mark Gotthelf. 
The model is accurate for all parts EXCEPT the slide. The slide in the model 
is an old slide for the robot which was replaced in the summer of 2015. The new
slide has an overall longer length but sits closer to the robot when fully retracted. 

This model can be used to determine the following D-H parameters for the Forward Kinematics model. 
These parameters are explained in Devon Holley's thesis. 
		d1, a2, d4, a5, d6, a6

In June 2017 Mark Gotthelf updated the track and trough in the model, 3D printed these parts
at Marquette's DLL and installed them on the robot. The track was updated to match the actual part
on the robot and printed because the track at that time was broke. The trough was updated with an
increased thickness that way the nuts sat flush in the trough to prevent scratching.
