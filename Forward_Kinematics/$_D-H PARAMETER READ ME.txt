The D-H parameters are discussed in Devon Holley's thesis. 
This information is included with other documentation in the 
folder 'Forward Kinematics'. 
The parameters are used in the MATLAB Simulink models to determine the XYZ
location of the end effector of the robot. For this orthosis robot the end
effector is joint 7, the center of the F/E joint. 
If the robot is update new values should be calalculated for each DH parameter.
